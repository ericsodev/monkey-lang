Multiple implementations of [Monkey Lang](https://monkeylang.org/) from the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C
- [ ] Typescript

## Purpose
- To understand the fundamentals of grammars used to describe languages
- To understand how to implement an extendable parser based on language's grammar
- To explore different language features in languages that I am not familiar with (Rust and Go)
- To extend Monkey Lang's base set of features and understand how common syntatic sugar is added to languages
